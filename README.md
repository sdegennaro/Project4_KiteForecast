### FUTURE FEATURES
Future versions of the app will prepopulate the forecast search for logged in users with their saved weight, latitude, and longitude. Users would also have the option of entering zip code and a longitude and latitude would be saved automatically for them. Future versions could include additional recommendations, such as what kind of wetsuit is needed, based on water temperature. I would also like to replace the background video with something more consistent (i.e. all ocean images).
