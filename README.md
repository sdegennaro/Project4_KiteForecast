### FUTURE FEATURES
At present, text messages must be sent manually through the '/text' route. In future versions of this app, we would add restrictions so that only users who have admin status could access that route (currently all users default as non-admins). We would also like to add the ability for a user to specify a time of day to receive their text message and for the program to send it automatically.
